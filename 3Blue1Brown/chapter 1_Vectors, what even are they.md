# Chapter 1: Vectors, what even are they?
## What is the vector?
* The fundamental, root-of-it-all building block for linear algebra
## Meaning of vector from different students
1. Physics: arrows pointing in space (defines vector need length and direction)
2. CS: ordered list of numbers
3. Mathmatics: a vector can be anything  (vectors can do addition and multiplication)
## In Linear Algebra the Vector will always origin at 0,0 in Space

> For example, the meaning of  (-2,3) represent the distance from origin (0,0) to the x axis and y axis separately, the meaning of positive and minus is the direction of space. There is a z-axis in the three dimensional.
## Geometric meaning of Vector
1. Addition:Sum of Two Vectors = move along vector 1 , then move along vector 2 then the total travel is the sum of the two vectors (ie Matrix addition )then following the end point from the origin

2. Scaling:Multiplication of vectors : scaling the factors by a factor multiplied

> vector can be longer or shorter or different direction by multiplying __scalars__
