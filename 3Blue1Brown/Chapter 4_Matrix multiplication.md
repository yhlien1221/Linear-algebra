* First rotation then shear (推移)

* Two times transformation is equal to a composition

* The composition is called the product of the original two matrices

* Two times transformation just the g function of f function
* Rotation first then shear, but matrix of rotation should put on the right side
## Example of two times transformation

* First is the i vector [1,1]

* i vector [1,1] was transformed by the M2

* Transformed i will be [2,1]

* Start to transform j vector [-2,0]

* Transformed j vector will be [0,-2]
