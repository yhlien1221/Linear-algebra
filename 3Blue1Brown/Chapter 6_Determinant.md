* Linear transformation:some strentch out grids and others squish (squeeze) grids. Determinant can bed used to measure the changed after linear transformation

* There is a vector [1,1]

* After transformation by the matrix, the i and j become three and two times

* The area after transformation

* We can say the linear transformation has scaled it's area by a factor of 6

* The area keeps the same after shear

* The transformation increases this area of the region by a factor of three
* A:Area

* Determinant is Zero 0 if the area squeeze down to Single

* Minus (-) determinant is caused due to flipping of Orientation of Space

* In 3D Matrix the Determinant is the Volume changed

* In 3D matrix, plus or minus of determinant is determined by __right-hand rule__
