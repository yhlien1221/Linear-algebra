# Chapter 2: Linear combinations, span and basis vectors
## What is basic vector?

## i and j are the basis of xy coordinate system (and everything else is just scaling these basis in the coordinate system)

* [Technical Definition :] The Basis of a vector is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space
* The choice of basis vector matters when choosing a coordinate system
## Linear combination

> Linear combination is the sum of vectors
## Different cases of linear combinations
1. Linear combination of two vectors can reach any arbitrary point in a flat if the two vectors are not collinear

2. Linear combination of two vectors will always be in the same line through origin if the two vectors are collinear

3. Linear combination of two vectors will always be zero vector if both of two vectors are zero vectors

## Span : of two vectors is set of all linear combinations (ie the points they can reach)

## Linearly independent
* If adding two vectors keeps the resultant vector span in the same dimension then they are Linearly dependent , and if their addition adds a new span of dimensions then they are “Linear independent”
