##Linear combinations, span and basis vectors
* i and j are the basis of xy coordinate system (and everything else is just scaling these basis in the coordinate system)
* [Technical Definition :] The Basis of a vector is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space
* The choice of basis vector matters when choosing a coordinate system
* Span : of two vectors is set of all linear combinations (ie the points they can reach)
* If adding two vectors keeps the resultant vector span in the same dimension then they are Linearly dependent , and if their addition adds a new span of dimensions then they are “Linear independent”
